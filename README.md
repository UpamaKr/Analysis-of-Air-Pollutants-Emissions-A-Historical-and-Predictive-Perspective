# Analysis-of-Air-Pollutants-Emissions-A-Historical-and-Predictive-Perspective
An exploration into the emissions of various air pollutants from 1750 to 2022 is presented in this analysis. The data, sourced from "Our World in Data", includes Nitrogen Oxide, Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Black Carbon (BC), Ammonia (NH₃), and Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC) emissions.

Visualizations of these trends have been created using Python and Plotly, providing an intuitive understanding of the data. The ARIMA model has been employed to predict the future emissions of CO for the next decade. Through this analysis, a deeper understanding of the past and future of air pollutant emissions is hoped to be achieved.
